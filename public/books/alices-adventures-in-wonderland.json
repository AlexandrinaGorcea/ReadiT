      "page_content": "CHAPTER I.\nDown the Rabbit-Hole\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of\nhaving nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was\nreading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,”\nthought Alice “without pictures or conversations?”\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made\nher feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would\nbe worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White\nRabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\nThere was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out\nof the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she\nthought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this,\nbut at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch\nout of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her\nfeet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a\nwaistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran\nacross the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large\nrabbit-hole under the hedge.\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the\nworld she was to get out again.\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped\nsuddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping\nherself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as\nshe went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First,\nshe tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see\nanything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled\nwith cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung\nupon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled\n“ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not\nlike to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into\none of the cupboards as she fell past it.\n“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of\ntumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say\nanything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)\nDown, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? “I wonder how many miles\nI’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be getting somewhere near the centre\nof the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you\nsee, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\nthough this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there\nwas no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about",

      "page_content": "the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice\nhad no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand\nwords to say.)\nPresently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny\nit’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The\nAntipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it\ndidn’t sound at all the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\ncountry is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?” (and she tried\nto curtsey as she spoke—fancy curtseying as you’re falling through the air! Do you think\nyou could manage it?) “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No,\nit’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again.\n“Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!” (Dinah was the cat.) “I hope\nthey’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down\nhere with me! There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and\nthat’s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here Alice\nbegan to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, “Do\ncats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she\ncouldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in\nhand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did\nyou ever eat a bat?” when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of\nsticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked\nup, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White\nRabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away\nwent Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh\nmy ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she turned\nthe corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low\nhall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had\nbeen all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly\ndown the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was\nnothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first thought was that it might\nbelong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the\nkey was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the\nsecond time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\nbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in\nthe lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger\nthan a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden\nyou ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among\nthose beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her\nhead through the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought poor\nAlice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut",

      "page_content": "up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many\nout-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few\nthings indeed were really impossible.\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table,\nhalf hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting\npeople up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was\nnot here before,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with\nthe words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large letters.\nIt was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was not going to do\nthat in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said, “and see whether it’s marked ‘poison’ or\nnot”; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt,\nand eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not\nremember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker\nwill burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a\nknife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a\nbottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.\nHowever, this bottle was not marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to taste it, and\nfinding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-\napple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\n* * * * * * *\n* * * * * *\n* * * * * * *\n“What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a telescope.”\nAnd so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up\nat the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into\nthat lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going\nto shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,”\nsaid Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should\nbe like then?” And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle\nis blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.\nAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the\ngarden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had\nforgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found\nshe could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she\ntried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when\nshe had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.\n“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself, rather sharply; “I\nadvise you to leave off this minute!” She generally gave herself very good advice,\n(though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as\nto bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for\nhaving cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this\ncurious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. “But it’s no use now,”",

      "page_content": "thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left\nto make one respectable person!”\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it,\nand found in it a very small cake, on which the words “EAT ME” were beautifully\nmarked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said Alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can\nreach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either\nway I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which way?”, holding\nher hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite\nsurprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens\nwhen one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but\nout-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on\nin the common way.\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\n* * * * * * *\n* * * * * *\n* * * * * * *",

      "page_content": "CHAPTER II.\nThe Pool of Tears\n“Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the\nmoment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now I’m opening out like the\nlargest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!” (for when she looked down at her feet,\nthey seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). “Oh, my poor little\nfeet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m sure I\nshan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must\nmanage the best way you can;—but I must be kind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps\nthey won’t walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots\nevery Christmas.”\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. “They must go by the\ncarrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending presents to one’s own feet!\nAnd how odd the directions will look!\nAlice’s Right Foot, Esq.,\nHearthrug,\nnear the Fender,\n(with Alice’s love).\nOh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”\nJust then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than\nnine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the\ngarden door.\nPoor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through\ninto the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat\ndown and began to cry again.\n“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like you,” (she might\nwell say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!” But she went\non all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her,\nabout four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.\nAfter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried\nher eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly\ndressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he\ncame trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “Oh! the\nDuchess, the Duchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt so\ndesperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her,\nshe began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please, sir—” The Rabbit started violently,\ndropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard\nas he could go.\nAlice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning",

I wonder if I’ve been changed in the night?\nLet me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can\nremember feeling a little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who in\nthe world am I? Ah, that’s the great puzzle!” And she began thinking over all the\nchildren she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been\nchanged for any of them.\n“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine\ndoesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things,\nand she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, she’s she, and I’m I, and—oh dear,\nhow puzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four\ntimes five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is—oh dear! I\nshall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t\nsignify: let’s try Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of\nRome, and Rome—no, that’s all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been changed for\nMabel! I’ll try and say ‘How doth the little—’” and she crossed her hands on her lap as if\nshe were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and\nstrange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:—\n“How doth the little crocodile\nImprove his shining tail,\nAnd pour the waters of the Nile\nOn every golden scale!\n“How cheerfully he seems to grin,\nHow neatly spread his claws,\nAnd welcome little fishes in\nWith gently smiling jaws!”\n“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with\ntears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in\nthat poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many\nlessons to learn! No, I’ve made up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here!\nIt’ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come up again, dear!’ I shall\nonly look up and say ‘Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that\nperson, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down here till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!”\ncried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, “I do wish they would put their heads down! I\nam so very tired of being all alone here!”\nAs she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had\nput on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while she was talking. “How can I have\ndone that?” she thought. “I must be growing small again.” She got up and went to the\ntable to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was\nnow about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that\nthe cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to\navoid shrinking away altogether.\n“That was a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change,\nbut very glad to find herself still in existence; “and now for the garden!” and she ran",

      "page_content": "with all speed back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the\nlittle golden key was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than\never,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as this before, never! And I\ndeclare it’s too bad, that it is!”\nAs she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up\nto her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea,\n“and in that case I can go back by railway,” she said to herself. (Alice had been to the\nseaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\nto on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some\nchildren digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and\nbehind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool\nof tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.\n“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way\nout. “I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That\nwill be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.”\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she\nswam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or\nhippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made\nout that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.\n“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse? Everything is\nso out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate,\nthere’s no harm in trying.” So she began: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this\npool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be\nthe right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she\nremembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of a mouse—to a\nmouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and\nseemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.\n“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s a French\nmouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For, with all her knowledge of\nhistory, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she\nbegan again: “Où est ma chatte?” which was the first sentence in her French lesson-\nbook. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over\nwith fright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the\npoor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot you didn’t like cats.”\n“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would you like cats if\nyou were me?”\n“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry about it. And yet I\nwish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d take a fancy to cats if you could only\nsee her. She is such a dear quiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily\nabout in the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and\nwashing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse—and she’s such a capital\none for catching mice—oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the\nMouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. “We won’t\ntalk about her any more if you’d rather not.”\n“We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail. “As if I\nwould talk on such a subject! Our family always hated cats: nasty, low, vulgar things!",

      "page_content": "Don’t let me hear the name again!”\n“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation.\n“Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on\neagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little\nbright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch\nthings when you throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of\nthings—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he\nsays it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and—oh\ndear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, “I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse\nwas swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in\nthe pool as it went.\nSo she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won’t talk\nabout cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When the Mouse heard this, it turned\nround and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice\nthought), and it said in a low trembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell\nyou my history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and\nanimals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and\nseveral other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the\nshore.",

      "page_content": "CHAPTER III.\nA Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\nThey were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the birds with\ndraggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping\nwet, cross, and uncomfortable.\nThe first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about\nthis, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking\nfamiliarly with them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long\nargument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am older than\nyou, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old\nit was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.\nAt last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out,\n“Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I’ll soon make you dry enough!” They all sat\ndown at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes\nanxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry\nvery soon.\n“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready? This is the driest\nthing I know. Silence all round, if you please! ‘William the Conqueror, whose cause was\nfavoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and\nhad been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the\nearls of Mercia and Northumbria—’”\n“Ugh!” said the Lory, with a shiver.\n“I beg your pardon!” said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: “Did you speak?”\n“Not I!” said the Lory hastily.\n“I thought you did,” said the Mouse. “—I proceed. ‘Edwin and Morcar, the earls of\nMercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop\nof Canterbury, found it advisable—’”\n“Found what?” said the Duck.\n“Found it,” the Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course you know what ‘it’ means.”\n“I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when I find a thing,” said the Duck: “it’s\ngenerally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the archbishop find?”\nThe Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, “‘—found it advisable\nto go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. William’s conduct\nat first was moderate. But the insolence of his Normans—’ How are you getting on\nnow, my dear?” it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.\n“As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t seem to dry me at all.”\n“In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, “I move that the meeting\nadjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies—”\n“Speak English!” said the Eaglet. “I don’t know the meaning of half those long words,\nand, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!” And the Eaglet bent down its head to\nhide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly.",

      "page_content": "“What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone, “was, that the best\nthing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”\n“What is a Caucus-race?” said Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but the Dodo\nhad paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak, and no one else seemed\ninclined to say anything.\n“Why,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.” (And, as you might like\nto try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)\nFirst it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact shape doesn’t matter,”\nit said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there. There was\nno “One, two, three, and away,” but they began running when they liked, and left off\nwhen they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,\nwhen they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo\nsuddenly called out “The race is over!” and they all crowded round it, panting, and\nasking, “But who has won?”\nThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat\nfor a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you\nusually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last\nthe Dodo said, “Everybody has won, and all must have prizes.”\n“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked.\n“Why, she, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole\nparty at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, “Prizes! Prizes!”\nAlice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and\npulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed\nthem round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece, all round.\n“But she must have a prize herself, you know,” said the Mouse.\n“Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely. “What else have you got in your pocket?”\nhe went on, turning to Alice.\n“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.\n“Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.\nThen they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the\nthimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble;” and, when it had\nfinished this short speech, they all cheered.\nAlice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did\nnot dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed,\nand took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.\nThe next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the\nlarge birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and\nhad to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a\nring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.\n“You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice, “and why it is you hate\n—C and D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.\n“Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing.\n“It is a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse’s tail;\n“but why do you call it sad?” And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was",

The\nDuchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as\nferrets are ferrets! Where can I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a\nmoment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very\ngood-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen—\neverything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with\nthe glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.\nVery soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her\nin an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what are you doing out here? Run home this\nmoment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!” And Alice was so much\nfrightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to\nexplain the mistake it had made.\n“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. “How surprised he’ll\nbe when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him his fan and gloves—that is, if I\ncan find them.” As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of\nwhich was a bright brass plate with the name “W. RABBIT,” engraved upon it. She went\nin without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real\nMary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.\n“How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for a rabbit! I\nsuppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!” And she began fancying the sort of\nthing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!’\n‘Coming in a minute, nurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.’ Only I\ndon’t think,” Alice went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering\npeople about like that!”\nBy this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window,\nand on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she\ntook up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her\neye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this\ntime with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her\nlips. “I know something interesting is sure to happen,” she said to herself, “whenever I\neat or drink anything; so I’ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow\nlarge again, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”\nIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half\nthe bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her\nneck from being broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite\nenough—I hope I shan’t grow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I\nhadn’t drunk quite so much!”\nAlas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing, and very soon\nhad to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this,\nand she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other",

Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put\none arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself “Now I\ncan do no more, whatever happens. What will become of me?”\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no\nlarger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of\nher ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t always\ngrowing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost\nwish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and yet—it’s rather curious, you\nknow, this sort of life! I do wonder what can have happened to me! When I used to read\nfairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the\nmiddle of one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when\nI grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now,” she added in a sorrowful tone; “at\nleast there’s no room to grow up any more here.”\n“But then,” thought Alice, “shall I never get any older than I am now? That’ll be a\ncomfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but then—always to have lessons to\nlearn! Oh, I shouldn’t like that!”\n“Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How can you learn lessons in here?\nWhy, there’s hardly room for you, and no room at all for any lesson-books!”\nAnd so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a\nconversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and\nstopped to listen.\n“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said the voice. “Fetch me my gloves this moment!” Then\ncame a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look\nfor her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now\nabout a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\nPresently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the door opened\ninwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure.\nAlice heard it say to itself “Then I’ll go round and get in at the window.”\n“That you won’t!” thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the\nRabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in\nthe air. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a\ncrash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen\ninto a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\nNext came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat! Pat! Where are you?” And then a voice\nshe had never heard before, “Sure then I’m here! Digging for apples, yer honour!”\n“Digging for apples, indeed!” said the Rabbit angrily. “Here! Come and help me out of\nthis!” (Sounds of more broken glass.)\n“Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”\n“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)\n“An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole window!”\n“Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.”\n“Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!”\nThere was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then;",

This\ntime there were two little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. “What a number of\ncucumber-frames there must be!” thought Alice. “I wonder what they’ll do next! As for\npulling me out of the window, I only wish they could! I’m sure I don’t want to stay in\nhere any longer!”\nShe waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of\nlittle cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made\nout the words: “Where’s the other ladder?—Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got\nthe other—Bill! fetch it here, lad!—Here, put ’em up at this corner—No, tie ’em together\nfirst—they don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh! they’ll do well enough; don’t be\nparticular—Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope—Will the roof bear?—Mind that loose\nslate—Oh, it’s coming down! Heads below!” (a loud crash)—“Now, who did that?—It\nwas Bill, I fancy—Who’s to go down the chimney?—Nay, I shan’t! You do it!—That I\nwon’t, then!—Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill! the master says you’re to go down the\nchimney!”\n“Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” said Alice to herself. “Shy, they\nseem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in Bill’s place for a good deal: this\nfireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I think I can kick a little!”\nShe drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard a\nlittle animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about\nin the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp\nkick, and waited to see what would happen next.\nThe first thing she heard was a general chorus of “There goes Bill!” then the Rabbit’s\nvoice along—“Catch him, you by the hedge!” then silence, and then another confusion\nof voices—“Hold up his head—Brandy now—Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow?\nWhat happened to you? Tell us all about it!”\nLast came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That’s Bill,” thought Alice,) “Well, I\nhardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m a deal too flustered to tell\nyou—all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a\nsky-rocket!”\n“So you did, old fellow!” said the others.\n“We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice called out as loud\nas she could, “If you do, I’ll set Dinah at you!”\nThere was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I wonder what they\nwill do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the roof off.” After a minute or two, they\nbegan moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to\nbegin with.”\n“A barrowful of what?” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt, for the next\nmoment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them\nhit her in the face. “I’ll put a stop to this,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d\nbetter not do that again!” which produced another dead silence.\nAlice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as\nthey lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head. “If I eat one of these cakes,”\nshe thought, “it’s sure to make some change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me",

      "page_content": "larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.”\nSo she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began\nshrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran\nout of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.\nThe poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who\nwere giving it something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\nappeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick\nwood.\n“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the\nwood, “is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into\nthat lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.”\nIt sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the\nonly difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while\nshe was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head\nmade her look up in a great hurry.\nAn enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly\nstretching out one paw, trying to touch her. “Poor little thing!” said Alice, in a coaxing\ntone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at\nthe thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up\nin spite of all her coaxing.\nHardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the\npuppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of\ndelight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind\na great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on\nthe other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels\nin its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play\nwith a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran\nround the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick,\nrunning a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking\nhoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue\nhanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\nThis seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at once,\nand ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy’s bark sounded\nquite faint in the distance.\n“And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup\nto rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: “I should have liked teaching\nit tricks very much, if—if I’d only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly\nforgotten that I’ve got to grow up again! Let me see—how is it to be managed? I suppose\nI ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?”\nThe great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at the flowers and\nthe blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat\nor drink under the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her,\nabout the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides\nof it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on\nthe top of it.",

Alice replied, rather shyly,\n“I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know who I was when I got up this\nmorning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.”\n“What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar sternly. “Explain yourself!”\n“I can’t explain myself, I’m afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m not myself, you see.”\n“I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.\n“I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice replied very politely, “for I can’t\nunderstand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very\nconfusing.”\n“It isn’t,” said the Caterpillar.\n“Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said Alice; “but when you have to turn\ninto a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then after that into a butterfly, I\nshould think you’ll feel it a little queer, won’t you?”\n“Not a bit,” said the Caterpillar.\n“Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said Alice; “all I know is, it would feel\nvery queer to me.”\n“You!” said the Caterpillar contemptuously. “Who are you?”\nWhich brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felt a\nlittle irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such very short remarks, and she drew herself\nup and said, very gravely, “I think, you ought to tell me who you are, first.”\n“Why?” said the Caterpillar.\nHere was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any good reason,\nand as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.\n“Come back!” the Caterpillar called after her. “I’ve something important to say!”\nThis sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.\n“Keep your temper,” said the Caterpillar.\n“Is that all?” said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could.\n“No,” said the Caterpillar.\nAlice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after\nall it might tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed away\nwithout speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth\nagain, and said, “So you think you’re changed, do you?”\n“I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I can’t remember things as I used—and I don’t keep",

However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would\ngo, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.\n“And now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand\nbit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it\nhad struck her foot!\nShe was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there\nwas no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat\nsome of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was\nhardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a\nmorsel of the lefthand bit.\n* * * * * * *\n* * * * * *",

She had just succeeded in curving it down into a\ngraceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be\nnothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp\nhiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was\nbeating her violently with its wings.\n“Serpent!” screamed the Pigeon.\n“I’m not a serpent!” said Alice indignantly. “Let me alone!”\n“Serpent, I say again!” repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added\nwith a kind of sob, “I’ve tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!”\n“I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said Alice.\n“I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried hedges,” the Pigeon\nwent on, without attending to her; “but those serpents! There’s no pleasing them!”\nAlice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying\nanything more till the Pigeon had finished.\n“As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the Pigeon; “but I must be on\nthe look-out for serpents night and day!

What are you?” said the Pigeon. “I can see you’re trying to invent something!”\n“I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of\nchanges she had gone through that day.\n“A likely story indeed!” said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt. “I’ve seen a\ngood many little girls in my time, but never one with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re\na serpent; and there’s no use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you\nnever tasted an egg!”\n“I have tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, who was a very truthful child; “but little",

Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept\ngetting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and\nuntwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in\nher hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the\nother, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded\nin bringing herself down to her usual height.\nIt was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite\nstrange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as\nusual. “Come, there’s half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I’m\nnever sure what I’m going to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to\nmy right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how is that to be\ndone, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little\nhouse in it about four feet high. “Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to\ncome upon them this size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!” So she began\nnibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she\nhad brought herself down to nine inches high.",

It was\nopened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and\nboth footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads. She\nfelt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to\nlisten.\nThe Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as\nlarge as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, “For\nthe Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.” The Frog-Footman\nrepeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little, “From\nthe Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.”\nThen they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\nAlice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their\nhearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other\nwas sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.\nAlice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\n“There’s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman, “and that for two reasons.\nFirst, because I’m on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they’re\nmaking such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.” And certainly there was a\nmost extraordinary noise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and\nevery now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.\n“Please, then,” said Alice, “how am I to get in?”\n“There might be some sense in your knocking,” the Footman went on without\nattending to her, “if we had the door between us. For instance, if you were inside, you\nmight knock, and I could let you out, you know.” He was looking up into the sky all the\ntime he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps he can’t\nhelp it,” she said to herself; “his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head. But at any\nrate he might answer questions.—How am I to get in?” she repeated, aloud.\n“I shall sit here,” the Footman remarked, “till tomorrow—”\nAt this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming out,\nstraight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one\nof the trees behind him.\n“—or next day, maybe,” the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly as if\nnothing had happened.\n“How am I to get in?” asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\n“Are you to get in at all?” said the Footman. “That’s the first question, you know.”\nIt was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. “It’s really dreadful,” she",

It’s enough to drive one crazy!”\nThe Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with\nvariations. “I shall sit here,” he said, “on and off, for days and days.”\n“But what am I to do?” said Alice.\n“Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling.\n“Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s perfectly idiotic!”\nAnd she opened the door and went in.\nThe door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the\nother: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby;\nthe cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of\nsoup.\n“There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to herself, as well as she\ncould for sneezing.\nThere was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally;\nand as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment’s\npause. The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat\nwhich was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\n“Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure\nwhether it was good manners for her to speak first, “why your cat grins like that?”\n“It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why. Pig!”\nShe said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she\nsaw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took\ncourage, and went on again:—\n“I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t know that cats\ncould grin.”\n“They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”\n“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have\ngot into a conversation.\n“You don’t know much,” said the Duchess; “and that’s a fact.”\nAlice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to\nintroduce some other subject of conversation. While she was trying to fix on one, the\ncook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing\neverything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first;\nthen followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\nthem even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it was\nquite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\n“Oh, please mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and down in an agony\nof terror. “Oh, there goes his precious nose!” as an unusually large saucepan flew close\nby it, and very nearly carried it off.\n“If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said in a hoarse growl, “the\nworld would go round a deal faster than it does.”\n“Which would not be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to get an\nopportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. “Just think of what work it would",

I—”\n“Oh, don’t bother me,” said the Duchess; “I never could abide figures!” And with that\nshe began nursing her child again, singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and\ngiving it a violent shake at the end of every line:\n“Speak roughly to your little boy,\nAnd beat him when he sneezes:\nHe only does it to annoy,\nBecause he knows it teases.”\nCHORUS.\n(In which the cook and the baby joined):\n“Wow! wow! wow!”\nWhile the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby\nviolently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly hear\nthe words:—\n“I speak severely to my boy,\nI beat him when he sneezes;\nFor he can thoroughly enjoy\nThe pepper when he pleases!”\nCHORUS.\n“Wow! wow! wow!”\n“Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!” the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby\nat her as she spoke. “I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,” and she\nhurried out of the room. The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it\njust missed her.\nAlice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped little creature,\nand held out its arms and legs in all directions, “just like a star-fish,” thought Alice. The\npoor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept\ndoubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first\nminute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.\nAs soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up\ninto a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to\nprevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air. “If I don’t take this child\naway with me,” thought Alice, “they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be\nmurder to leave it behind?” She said the last words out loud, and the little thing",

There could be no doubt that it had a very turn-up nose, much\nmore like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby:\naltogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all. “But perhaps it was only\nsobbing,” she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.\nNo, there were no tears. “If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,” said Alice,\nseriously, “I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind now!” The poor little thing\nsobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for some\nwhile in silence.\nAlice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do with this creature\nwhen I get it home?” when it grunted again, so violently, that she looked down into its\nface in some alarm. This time there could be no mistake about it: it was neither more\nnor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.\nSo she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly\ninto the wood. “If it had grown up,” she said to herself, “it would have made a\ndreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.” And she began\nthinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just\nsaying to herself, “if one only knew the right way to change them—” when she was a\nlittle startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.\nThe Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she thought: still it\nhad very long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with\nrespect.\n“Cheshire Puss,” she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it\nwould like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider. “Come, it’s pleased so far,”\nthought Alice, and she went on. “Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go\nfrom here?”\n“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.\n“I don’t much care where—” said Alice.\n“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.\n“—so long as I get somewhere,” Alice added as an explanation.\n“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long enough.”\nAlice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question. “What sort of\npeople live about here?”\n“In that direction,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives a Hatter: and in\nthat direction,” waving the other paw, “lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they’re\nboth mad.”\n“But I don’t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked.\n“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here. I’m mad. You’re mad.”\n“How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice.\n“You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’t have come here.”\nAlice didn’t think that proved it at all; however, she went on “And how do you know",

You grant that?”\n“I suppose so,” said Alice.\n“Well, then,” the Cat went on, “you see, a dog growls when it’s angry, and wags its\ntail when it’s pleased. Now I growl when I’m pleased, and wag my tail when I’m angry.\nTherefore I’m mad.”\n“I call it purring, not growling,” said Alice.\n“Call it what you like,” said the Cat. “Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?”\n“I should like it very much,” said Alice, “but I haven’t been invited yet.”\n“You’ll see me there,” said the Cat, and vanished.\nAlice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things\nhappening. While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared\nagain.\n“By-the-bye, what became of the baby?” said the Cat. “I’d nearly forgotten to ask.”\n“It turned into a pig,” Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way.\n“I thought it would,” said the Cat, and vanished again.\nAlice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a\nminute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live.\n“I’ve seen hatters before,” she said to herself; “the March Hare will be much the most\ninteresting, and perhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it\nwas in March.” As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a\nbranch of a tree.\n“Did you say pig, or fig?” said the Cat.\n“I said pig,” replied Alice; “and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing and vanishing so\nsuddenly: you make one quite giddy.”\n“All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the\nend of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it\nhad gone.\n“Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a grin without a cat!\nIt’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!”\nShe had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March\nHare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like\nears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not like to\ngo nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised\nherself to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly,\nsaying to herself “Suppose it should be raving mad after all!

No room!” they cried out when they saw Alice coming. “There’s plenty of\nroom!” said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the\ntable.\n“Have some wine,” the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\nAlice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. “I don’t see any\nwine,” she remarked.\n“There isn’t any,” said the March Hare.\n“Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,” said Alice angrily.\n“It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,” said the March Hare.\n“I didn’t know it was your table,” said Alice; “it’s laid for a great many more than\nthree.”\n“Your hair wants cutting,” said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice for some\ntime with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.\n“You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with some severity; “it’s\nvery rude.”\nThe Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he said was, “Why is a\nraven like a writing-desk?”\n“Come, we shall have some fun now!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they’ve begun asking\nriddles.—I believe I can guess that,” she added aloud.\n“Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?” said the March Hare.\n“Exactly so,” said Alice.\n“Then you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on.\n“I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I say—that’s the same\nthing, you know.”\n“Not the same thing a bit!” said the Hatter. “You might just as well say that ‘I see\nwhat I eat’ is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see’!”\n“You might just as well say,” added the March Hare, “that ‘I like what I get’ is the\nsame thing as ‘I get what I like’!”\n“You might just as well say,” added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in his\nsleep, “that ‘I breathe when I sleep’ is the same thing as ‘I sleep when I breathe’!”\n“It is the same thing with you,” said the Hatter, and here the conversation dropped,\nand the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all she could remember",

The Hatter’s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning\nin it, and yet it was certainly English. “I don’t quite understand you,” she said, as\npolitely as she could.\n“The Dormouse is asleep again,” said the Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon\nits nose.\nThe Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes, “Of\ncourse, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.”\n“Have you guessed the riddle yet?” the Hatter said, turning to Alice again.\n“No, I give it up,” Alice replied: “what’s the answer?”\n“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said the Hatter.\n“Nor I,” said the March Hare.\nAlice sighed wearily. “I think you might do something better with the time,” she\nsaid, “than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.”\n“If you knew Time as well as I do,” said the Hatter, “you wouldn’t talk about wasting\nit.

Alice thought this\na very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to\nthem she heard one of them say, “Look out now, Five! Don’t go splashing paint over me\nlike that!”\n“I couldn’t help it,” said Five, in a sulky tone; “Seven jogged my elbow.”\nOn which Seven looked up and said, “That’s right, Five! Always lay the blame on\nothers!”\n“You’d better not talk!” said Five. “I heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved\nto be beheaded!”\n“What for?” said the one who had spoken first.\n“That’s none of your business, Two!” said Seven.\n“Yes, it is his business!” said Five, “and I’ll tell him—it was for bringing the cook\ntulip-roots instead of onions.”\nSeven flung down his brush, and had just begun “Well, of all the unjust things—”\nwhen his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them, and he checked\nhimself suddenly: the others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.\n“Would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, “why you are painting those roses?”\nFive and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low voice, “Why the\nfact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a red rose-tree, and we put a white\none in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut\noff, you know. So you see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to—” At this\nmoment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out “The\nQueen! The Queen!” and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon\ntheir faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see\nthe Queen.\nFirst came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners,\noblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these\nwere ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did.\nAfter these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\njumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts.\nNext came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the\nWhite Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that\nwas said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts,\ncarrying the King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand\nprocession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\nAlice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the\nthree gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at\nprocessions; “and besides, what would be the use of a procession,” thought she, “if",

I needn’t be afraid of them!”\n“And who are these?” said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying\nround the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on\ntheir backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were\ngardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children.\n“How should I know?” said Alice, surprised at her own courage. “It’s no business of\nmine.”\nThe Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a\nwild beast, screamed “Off with her head! Off—”\n“Nonsense!” said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent.\nThe King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said “Consider, my dear: she is\nonly a child!”\nThe Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave “Turn them over!”\nThe Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\n“Get up!” said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three gardeners instantly\njumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the royal children, and\neverybody else.\n“Leave off that!” screamed the Queen. “You make me giddy.” And then, turning to\nthe rose-tree, she went on, “What have you been doing here?”\n“May it please your Majesty,” said Two, in a very humble tone, going down on one\nknee as he spoke, “we were trying—”\n“I see!” said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses. “Off with\ntheir heads!” and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to\nexecute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.\n“You shan’t be beheaded!” said Alice, and she put them into a large flower-pot that\nstood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them,\nand then quietly marched off after the others.\n“Are their heads off?” shouted the Queen.\n“Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!” the soldiers shouted in reply.\n“That’s right!” shouted the Queen. “Can you play croquet?”\nThe soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was evidently meant for\nher.\n“Yes!” shouted Alice.\n“Come on, then!” roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession, wondering very\nmuch what would happen next.",

She was walking by the\nWhite Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.\n“Very,” said Alice: “—where’s the Duchess?”\n“Hush! Hush!” said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked anxiously over his\nshoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her\near, and whispered “She’s under sentence of execution.”\n“What for?” said Alice.\n“Did you say ‘What a pity!’?” the Rabbit asked.\n“No, I didn’t,” said Alice: “I don’t think it’s at all a pity. I said ‘What for?’”\n“She boxed the Queen’s ears—” the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little scream of\nlaughter. “Oh, hush!” the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone. “The Queen will hear\nyou! You see, she came rather late, and the Queen said—”\n“Get to your places!” shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and people began\nrunning about in all directions, tumbling up against each other; however, they got\nsettled down in a minute or two, and the game began. Alice thought she had never seen\nsuch a curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were\nlive hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves\nup and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\nThe chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded\nin getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs\nhanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and\nwas going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it would twist itself round and\nlook up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out\nlaughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was\nvery provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of\ncrawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way\nwherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were\nalways getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the\nconclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\nThe players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while,\nand fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious\npassion, and went stamping about, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with her\nhead!” about once in a minute.\nAlice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute with\nthe Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, “and then,” thought she,\n“what would become of me? They’re dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the\ngreat wonder is, that there’s any one left alive!”\nShe was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get\naway without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air: it puzzled\nher very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a\ngrin, and she said to herself “It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk\nto.”\n“How are you getting on?” said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth enough for it to\nspeak with.\nAlice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. “It’s no use speaking to it,” she",

The Cat seemed to think that\nthere was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\n“I don’t think they play at all fairly,” Alice began, in rather a complaining tone, “and\nthey all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear oneself speak—and they don’t seem to\nhave any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you’ve\nno idea how confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the arch I’ve\ngot to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground—and I should\nhave croqueted the Queen’s hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine\ncoming!”\n“How do you like the Queen?” said the Cat in a low voice.\n“Not at all,” said Alice: “she’s so extremely—” Just then she noticed that the Queen\nwas close behind her, listening: so she went on, “—likely to win, that it’s hardly worth\nwhile finishing the game.”\nThe Queen smiled and passed on.\n“Who are you talking to?” said the King, going up to Alice, and looking at the Cat’s\nhead with great curiosity.\n“It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said Alice: “allow me to introduce it.”\n“I don’t like the look of it at all,” said the King: “however, it may kiss my hand if it\nlikes.”\n“I’d rather not,” the Cat remarked.\n“Don’t be impertinent,” said the King, “and don’t look at me like that!” He got behind\nAlice as he spoke.\n“A cat may look at a king,” said Alice. “I’ve read that in some book, but I don’t\nremember where.”\n“Well, it must be removed,” said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen,\nwho was passing at the moment, “My dear! I wish you would have this cat removed!”\nThe Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small. “Off with his\nhead!” she said, without even looking round.\n“I’ll fetch the executioner myself,” said the King eagerly, and he hurried off.\nAlice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as she\nheard the Queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with passion. She had already heard\nher sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she\ndid not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never\nknew whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.\nThe hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice\nan excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the only difficulty\nwas, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice\ncould see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.\nBy the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and\nboth the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it doesn’t matter much,” thought Alice, “as\nall the arches are gone from this side of the ground.” So she tucked it away under her\narm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with",

Soup does very well without—Maybe it’s\nalways pepper that makes people hot-tempered,” she went on, very much pleased at\nhaving found out a new kind of rule, “and vinegar that makes them sour—and\ncamomile that makes them bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make\nchildren sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn’t be so\nstingy about it, you know—”\nShe had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when she\nheard her voice close to her ear. “You’re thinking about something, my dear, and that\nmakes you forget to talk. I can’t tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall\nremember it in a bit.”\n“Perhaps it hasn’t one,” Alice ventured to remark.\n“Tut, tut, child!” said the Duchess. “Everything’s got a moral, if only you can find it.”\nAnd she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’s side as she spoke.\nAlice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess was very\nugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon\nAlice’s shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to\nbe rude, so she bore it as well as she could.\n“The game’s going on rather better now,” she said, by way of keeping up the\nconversation a little.\n“’Tis so,” said the Duchess: “and the moral of that is—‘Oh, ’tis love, ’tis love, that\nmakes the world go round!’”\n“Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that it’s done by everybody minding their own\nbusiness!”\n“Ah, well! It means much the same thing,” said the Duchess, digging her sharp little\nchin into Alice’s shoulder as she added, “and the moral of that is—‘Take care of the\nsense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.’”\n“How fond she is of finding morals in things!” Alice thought to herself.\n“I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your waist,” the Duchess\nsaid after a pause: “the reason is, that I’m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo.\nShall I try the experiment?”\n“He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have the\nexperiment tried.",

He\nlooked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice. “Same\nas if he had a bone in his throat,” said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and\npunching him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears\nrunning down his cheeks, he went on again:—\n“You may not have lived much under the sea—” (“I haven’t,” said Alice)—“and\nperhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—” (Alice began to say “I once\ntasted—” but checked herself hastily, and said “No, never”) “—so you can have no idea\nwhat a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is!”\n“No, indeed,” said Alice. “What sort of a dance is it?”\n“Why,” said the Gryphon, “you first form into a line along the sea-shore—”\n“Two lines!” cried the Mock Turtle. “Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on; then, when\nyou’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—”\n“That generally takes some time,” interrupted the Gryphon.\n“—you advance twice—”\n“Each with a lobster as a partner!” cried the Gryphon.\n“Of course,” the Mock Turtle said: “advance twice, set to partners—”\n“—change lobsters, and retire in same order,” continued the Gryphon.\n“Then, you know,” the Mock Turtle went on, “you throw the—”\n“The lobsters!” shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.\n“—as far out to sea as you can—”\n“Swim after them!” screamed the Gryphon.\n“Turn a somersault in the sea!” cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about.\n“Change lobsters again!” yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.\n“Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,” said the Mock Turtle, suddenly\ndropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad\nthings all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.\n“It must be a very pretty dance,” said Alice timidly.\n“Would you like to see a little of it?” said the Mock Turtle.\n“Very much indeed,” said Alice.\n“Come, let’s try the first figure!” said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon. “We can do\nwithout lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?”\n“Oh, you sing,” said the Gryphon. “I’ve forgotten the words.”\nSo they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then\ntreading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their forepaws to mark\nthe time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly:—",

But they have their tails in their mouths; and the reason is—” here the Mock\nTurtle yawned and shut his eyes.—“Tell her about the reason and all that,” he said to\nthe Gryphon.\n“The reason is,” said the Gryphon, “that they would go with the lobsters to the dance.\nSo they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast\nin their mouths. So they couldn’t get them out again. That’s all.”\n“Thank you,” said Alice, “it’s very interesting. I never knew so much about a whiting\nbefore.”\n“I can tell you more than that, if you like,” said the Gryphon. “Do you know why it’s\ncalled a whiting?”\n“I never thought about it,” said Alice. “Why?”\n“It does the boots and shoes,” the Gryphon replied very solemnly.\nAlice was thoroughly puzzled. “Does the boots and shoes!” she repeated in a\nwondering tone.\n“Why, what are your shoes done with?” said the Gryphon. “I mean, what makes them",

Now you know.”\n“And what are they made of?” Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.\n“Soles and eels, of course,” the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: “any shrimp\ncould have told you that.”\n“If I’d been the whiting,” said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the song,\n“I’d have said to the porpoise, ‘Keep back, please: we don’t want you with us!’”\n“They were obliged to have him with them,” the Mock Turtle said: “no wise fish\nwould go anywhere without a porpoise.”\n“Wouldn’t it really?” said Alice in a tone of great surprise.\n“Of course not,” said the Mock Turtle: “why, if a fish came to me, and told me he was\ngoing a journey, I should say ‘With what porpoise?’”\n“Don’t you mean ‘purpose’?” said Alice.\n“I mean what I say,” the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And the Gryphon\nadded “Come, let’s hear some of your adventures.”\n“I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,” said Alice a little\ntimidly: “but it’s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.”\n“Explain all that,” said the Mock Turtle.\n“No, no! The adventures first,” said the Gryphon in an impatient tone: “explanations\ntake such a dreadful time.”\nSo Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the\nWhite Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so\nclose to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide, but she\ngained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part\nabout her repeating “You are old, Father William,” to the Caterpillar, and the words all\ncoming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said “That’s very\ncurious.”\n“It’s all about as curious as it can be,” said the Gryphon.\n“It all came different!” the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. “I should like to hear\nher try and repeat something now. Tell her to begin.” He looked at the Gryphon as if he\nthought it had some kind of authority over Alice.\n“Stand up and repeat ‘’Tis the voice of the sluggard,’” said the Gryphon.\n“How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!” thought Alice; “I\nmight as well be at school at once.” However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her\nhead was so full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying,\nand the words came very queer indeed:—\n“’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\n“You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.”\nAs a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose\nTrims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.”",

In the very middle of the court was a\ntable, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite\nhungry to look at them—“I wish they’d get the trial done,” she thought, “and hand\nround the refreshments!” But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began\nlooking at everything about her, to pass away the time.\nAlice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in\nbooks, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything\nthere. “That’s the judge,” she said to herself, “because of his great wig.”\nThe judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the wig, (look at\nthe frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and\nit was certainly not becoming.\n“And that’s the jury-box,” thought Alice, “and those twelve creatures,” (she was\nobliged to say “creatures,” you see, because some of them were animals, and some were\nbirds,) “I suppose they are the jurors.” She said this last word two or three times over to\nherself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little\ngirls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, “jury-men” would have done\njust as well.\nThe twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. “What are they doing?” Alice\nwhispered to the Gryphon. “They can’t have anything to put down yet, before the\ntrial’s begun.”\n“They’re putting down their names,” the Gryphon whispered in reply, “for fear they\nshould forget them before the end of the trial.”\n“Stupid things!” Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped hastily, for\nthe White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in the court!” and the King put on his spectacles\nand looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking.\nAlice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors\nwere writing down “stupid things!” on their slates, and she could even make out that\none of them didn’t know how to spell “stupid,” and that he had to ask his neighbour to\ntell him. “A nice muddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!” thought Alice.\nOne of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice could not stand,\nand she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity\nof taking it away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard)\ncould not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he\nwas obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little\nuse, as it left no mark on the slate.\n“Herald, read the accusation!” said the King.",

He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of\nbread-and-butter in the other. “I beg pardon, your Majesty,” he began, “for bringing\nthese in: but I hadn’t quite finished my tea when I was sent for.”\n“You ought to have finished,” said the King. “When did you begin?”\nThe Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm-in-\narm with the Dormouse. “Fourteenth of March, I think it was,” he said.\n“Fifteenth,” said the March Hare.\n“Sixteenth,” added the Dormouse.\n“Write that down,” the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all\nthree dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer to\nshillings and pence.\n“Take off your hat,” the King said to the Hatter.\n“It isn’t mine,” said the Hatter.\n“Stolen!” the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a\nmemorandum of the fact.\n“I keep them to sell,” the Hatter added as an explanation; “I’ve none of my own.

She soon got it out again, and put it right; “not that it\nsignifies much,” she said to herself; “I should think it would be quite as much use in the\ntrial one way up as the other.”\nAs soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their\nslates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very\ndiligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too\nmuch overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of\nthe court.\n“What do you know about this business?” the King said to Alice.\n“Nothing,” said Alice.\n“Nothing whatever?” persisted the King.\n“Nothing whatever,” said Alice.\n“That’s very important,” the King said, turning to the jury.

(Which he certainly did\nnot, being made entirely of cardboard.)\n“All right, so far,” said the King, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself:\n“‘We know it to be true—’ that’s the jury, of course—‘I gave her one, they gave him two—’",

Then again—‘before she had this fit—’ you never had\nfits, my dear, I think?” he said to the Queen.\n“Never!” said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke.\n(The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found\nit made no mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling\ndown his face, as long as it lasted.)\n“Then the words don’t fit you,” said the King, looking round the court with a smile.\nThere was a dead silence.\n“It’s a pun!” the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, “Let the\njury consider their verdict,” the King said, for about the twentieth time that day.\n“No, no!” said the Queen. “Sentence first—verdict afterwards.”\n“Stuff and nonsense!” said Alice loudly. “The idea of having the sentence first!”\n“Hold your tongue!” said the Queen, turning purple.\n“I won’t!” said Alice.\n“Off with her head!” the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved.\n“Who cares for you?” said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this time.) “You’re\nnothing but a pack of cards!”\nAt this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave\na little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found\nherself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently\nbrushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.\n“Wake up, Alice dear!” said her sister; “Why, what a long sleep you’ve had!”\n“Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!” said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she\ncould remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been\nreading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, “It was a\ncurious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.” So Alice got\nup and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it\nhad been.\nBut her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the\nsetting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too\nbegan dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:—\nFirst, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped\nupon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers—she could hear the\nvery tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the\nwandering hair that would always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or\nseemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures\nof her little sister’s dream.\nThe long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the frightened",
